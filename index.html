                <div class="salience-desc desc invisible" id="c-salience-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Salience - the dominant and most eye-catching object/character in an image. <br>
                        The most salient image in this image is the carpet.
                        The carpet's bright red contrasts with the background,
                        and also highlights the girl sitting on the carpet.
                        Since this is the most salient feature, it is easy to tell that the girl is the main character,
                        and the carpet it also very  important in terms of storyline.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="vectors-desc  desc invisible" id="c-vectors-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Vectors - lines in an image pointing to a specific spot. <br>
                        Some of the main vectors would be the carpet.
                        The carpet points ahead, signalling that there is a long journey ahead.
                        Most of the walls also point forward, maybe giving off the same message.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="offer-desc desc invisible" id="c-offer-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Offer - When the character/s are looking away from you. <br>
                       The girl is looking away from us,
                        which means this image is offer, and not demand.
                        Since she is looking forward, it could be signalling that there is a lot of stuff up ahead.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="demand-desc desc invisible" id="c-demand-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Demand - when the character is looking at you. <br>
                        There is no demand in this image.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="colour-desc desc invisible" id="c-colour-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Colour - the colours in the image and what they portray. <br>
                        The bright red carpet makes it salient,
                        the dim orange, leaking yellow and violet show that it is currently sunrise/sunset.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="angles-desc desc invisible" id="c-angles-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Angles - the angle in which the character is seen from. <br>
                        The angle is a high angle, showing that the girl is small compared to the whole world.
                        The image's POV is also birds-eye-view, which shows the whole area and the character.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="position-desc desc invisible" id="c-position-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Position - how an object/character is placed in am image. <br>
                        The girl and the carpet is position in the top third of the image.
                        Most of the background is in the bottom third, except for the cage and tower, which go up to the top third.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="modality-desc desc visible" id="c-modality-1">
                    <p class="inner-text">Modality - how a real life lesson is portrayed in an image/story. <br>
                        The modality in this image represents that one person is just a small thing in comparison to the whole world.
